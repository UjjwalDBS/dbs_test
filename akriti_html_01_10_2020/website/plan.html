    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">BEST TIME TO VISIT!</h1>
    <img class = "hr-break" src ="x-removebg-preview.png">
    <p>The largest state in India, Rajasthan's climate can be divided into four seasons i.e. summer, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter. Temperatures vary depending on the season and the region you plan to visit, but by and large you can visit the state any time of year and find something new to do each time.

      Summers in Rajasthan last from April to June and are particularly harsh with temperatures rising up to 48°C during the day. That being said, if you do plan to visit Rajasthan in the summer, head to places like Mount Abu, Kumbhalgarh or Ranakpur. The weather here is pleasant and the views offered are breath-taking. For other cities, the weather is optimal in the early evenings for roaming around outside in the early mornings and late evenings, and it is advisable to stay indoors otherwise.
      
      Monsoon is a far more pleasant experience, the temperatures tend to drop across the state and the rain showers transform the arid landscape of Rajasthan. July to September is a particularly good time to visit if you wish to avoid the crowds you'd usually find during peak tourist season. Bundi, the lake city of Udaipur and the Keoladeo National Park are picturesque and are a must visit if you plan to travel to Rajasthan during the Monsoon.
      
      The temperatures continue to drop once the monsoon has passed, and come October winter sets in that lasts till March. During December and January, there can be a severe variation in temperatures during the day and the night. In fact, temperatures are known to drop as low as 0°C and below. This is the best time to visit Rajasthan as the desert sun is not as intense and the days are pleasant. Most of the festivals held in winter are planned as tourist attractions, with visitors coming in from different parts of the world.

    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">HOW TO GET THERE?</h1>
    <img class = "hr-break" src ="x-removebg-preview.png">
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">AIR</h4><p>
Rajasthan is a tourist hub and therefore well-connected by air. Whether you're flying in from within the country or from another one, you'll find that there are a host of options you can choose from based on your itinerary. The three major airports of Rajasthan are Sanganer International Airport in Jaipur, Jodhpur Airport and Dabok Airport in Udaipur. While Sanganer is open to domestic and international air traffic, Jodhpur and Udaipur only serve domestic routes and Jodhpur also doubles up as a base for the Indian Air Force. These three airports collectively connect Rajasthan to most major cities in India, with Jaipur Airport also offering connections to some international destinations such as Muscat, Singapore, Abu Dhabi etc. With tourism booming in the state, plans are in motion to construct an airport in Ajmer and revive operations to Kota, Jaisalmer and Bikaner in the future which will make flying to Rajasthan easy.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">ROAD</h4><p>
      Rajasthan has 20 national highways passing through the state, spanning a distance of about 6373 kms. The NH-8 which connects Mumbai to Delhi is the busiest national highway in Rajasthan and runs through Ajmer, Jaipur, Udaipur and Chittorgarh. Besides the NH-8, Rajasthan is also connected to other major cities in India such as Delhi, Ahmedabad and Indore by state highways. You can very well choose to drive to Rajasthan or hop onto a bus operated by the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation, if you prefer travelling by road.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">RAIL</h4><p>
      Rail is one of the best ways to travel to Rajasthan from anywhere within India as it is both, comfortable and economical. The state is well-connected to all the major cities across the nation and there are several routes to opt from. The major railway stations of Rajasthan are Jaipur, Kota, Bharatpur, Bikaner, Ajmer, Alwar, Udaipur, Abu Road and Jodhpur. But out of this lot, Jaipur and Kota are major hubs connecting the major cities of India to Rajasthan.
