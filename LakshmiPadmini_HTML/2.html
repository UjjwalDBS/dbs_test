<h3> Software Defined Networking </h3>
<p>Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach 
to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically 
efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, 
making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.</p>
<p>
Software-defined networking (SDN) is the continuation of a trend away from traditional networking. In the earlier standard architecture network traffic decisions were made by the devices in place and determined by preset routing tables. The SDN style is a more adaptive version of the process. In this networking, an engineer or administrator shapes how the traffic moves from a centralized console.
This is a more fluid version of networking that allows for tailor-made methods and customization. When implemented properly, this process empowers business to have a more responsive network that reacts to the changing needs of the business. This promises to simplify the overall control of the enterprise network. On top of all that, there are several more benefits of implementing software-defined networking.
</p>
<p>Advantages of SDN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing Operating Costs: SDN will allow for multi-tasking in network operations. That requires less equipment and doesn’t need the expensive network switches that would be used in the traditional style. SDN also adapts well with virtualization which will reduce your need for more hardware. </li>
<li>A Detailed Approach to Security: It is much easier to control and monitor your security features from one centralized console, rather than multiple applications spread throughout your systems. You will have one central point from which to conduct security policy and spread information from. /li>
<li>Centralized Operational Control: This is the centerpiece of the whole approach. Being able to influence the entire operation from one console offers the ability to have more efficient control over network traffic and task allocation. From this centralized console, you can increase the overall productivity of your systems and network. </li>
<li>Enterprise-wide Management: Businesses often require multiple applications and virtual machines to be running at all times to accommodate the big data requests. Software-defined networking lets your IT manager experiment with the best ways to manage this flow. It also supports the functions of physical and virtual devices at the same time. </li>
<li>Content Delivery: SDN makes it possible to guarantee a higher quality of user experience. Greater control over network responsiveness allows for high-quality streaming video and other forms of multimedia. This enables a level of control and automation that will ensure a more certainty in overall content delivery. </li>
<li>Automation: It might sound counterintuitive, but software-defined networking allows for a level of automation that will actually help you. It will ramp your speed up for the overall network. In the early days of resources like cloud-computing, networks would struggle to keep up despite excellent internet connectivity. In SDN, you can alter automated responses with tools like cloud management. This is especially helpful in environments like enterprise-wide SD-WAN networks. </li>
<li>Cloud Unification: The cloud and its resources are only going to take over more and more of our daily operations. The trend has spoken and won’t be turning around any time soon. It is in our benefit to find the best ways to work within the cloud rather than resist it. Software-defined networking will make it simple to unite your cloud resources despite them being in a possibly distant data center. A platform with massive components and many working parts can all be managed from one centralized console.</li>
<p>
Software-defined networking is a modern solution to the now old-problem of slow response times and rerouting around service outages. By the time you are alerted to major issues, your software-based network can already be working on the best possible solution. In this case, your software becomes an employee that is never afraid to work overnight and always knows what to do.
