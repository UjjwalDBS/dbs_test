      The Magnetic Hill in Ladakh is a road stretching on the Leh to Kargil national highway in the Himalayan region at an altitude of 14,000 KMs which is about 30 km from Leh. Magnetic Hill has Sindhu River flowing in its east which gives it picturesque beauty with the background of magnificent Himalayan Mountains. Magnetic Hill of Ladakh is also known as the ‘gravity hill’ since the area layout and the surrounding land creates an optical illusion by making a downhill slope appear to be an uphill slope. So, if a car is kept in neutral gear, it will start rolling uphill against gravity up to 20 Km per hour speed on its own. It is conceived that this mysterious wonder happens due to magnetic force. Hence the aircraft flying on this region increase its altitude to escape the influence of the magnetic field. Some people just drive through this region without knowing this effect. But those who know would stop their car at the spot to experience this mystical happening. This effect will work only at the right spot not anywhere else.

    Pangong Tso translated as "high grassland lake" in Tibetan is a spectacular lake in the Himalayas situated at a height of about 4,350 m and 134 km long. The colour of Pangong Tso Lake changes to the different shades of blue, green and an unusual red. Pangong Tso is an endorheic lake because the water flow is terminated before reaching the ocean hence the minerals and salts are retained in this lake. Since there is no way for salt outflow, the water in the lake is salty. But during winter from November to March, the lake freezes completely even though it is a saline lake. So the best time to visit this dazzling lake is during summer between June and October.
