<h1>What is AR or Augmented Reality?</h1>
<p>
AR or Augmented reality technology is a science fiction idea that thankfully turned true! The fundamental idea behind augmented reality is to add something extra to your experience of reality. So, if you are watching a movie or playing a game, AR adds to that experience in some way or form to turn the experience immersive and interactive.
Today, we've managed to achieve this by overlaying digital information onto a real-world environment via a headset or a smartphone. But, a true AR experience also includes other sensory modalities such as sound, touch, and olfactory. This is often achieved by accessories that go with the AR headsets to create a sensory enriched environment.
Now that you know the meaning of AR, let's find out how augmented reality works.

<h1>How Augmented Reality Works?</h1>
<p>
The very idea of mixing the real and virtual worlds sounds futuristic and exciting. To achieve such a feat, AR needs the help of a few components. These include a camera, sensors, computer vision, and a display.
Cameras and sensors gather information about the environment where the AR content needs to be overlayed. A computer vision system or a processing unit interprets this information. It determines how to integrate virtual objects in a real-world environment. A display finally streams the AR content for the user.
If you notice, these components are readily available in today's smartphones. But, for advanced and more realistic AR experiences, self-contained AR headsets are used that operate on the same principle.
