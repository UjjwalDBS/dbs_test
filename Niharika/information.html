<h1Finding, and offering, hope during a crisis></h1>
<p>Mr Goh Heng Hock, 60, is the second generation in his family to sell fishball noodles.
He has been in the business for almost 30 years. Commenting on the Covid-19 outbreak, he says simply, “No crisis has affected my stall so much before.”
During Singapore’s circuit breaker period, where people were advised to stay home and eating out was not allowed, Mr Goh’s food stall revenue fell by up to 50%.
A glimmer of light at the end of what seemed to be an interminable tunnel came when he was roped in to be part of The Food Bank Singapore’s “Feed the City – DBS Edition” programme, 
supported by the DBS Stronger Together Fund and the bank’s fund-raising from the public and its staff.
